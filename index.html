            <p>Military tactical mission requirements include distributed Command and Control (C2), Situational
                Awareness
                (SA), navigation, and Cooperative Integrated Fire Control (CIFC). It is critical to collaborate,
                coordinate
                and rapidly disseminate combat ID, classification and target assignments across shooters, sensors and
                weapons.There is an urgent need for increased connectivity and capacity between the tactical ant.</p>

            <h2>Connecting One Location To another</h2>
            <p>In a telecommunications network, a link is a communication channel that connects two or more devices for
                the purpose of data transmission. The link may be a dedicated physical link or a virtual circuit that
                uses one or more physical links or shares a physical link with other telecommunications links.

                A telecommunications link is generally based on one of several types of information transmission paths
                such as those provided by communication satellites, terrestrial radio communications infrastructure and
                computer networks to connect two or more points.</p>
